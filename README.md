## 📌 Overview

> This repository documents my **real-world industrial robotic training**, transitioning from simulation-based robotics into **factory-grade robot programming and automation**.

I worked with a **6-axis Mitsubishi industrial robot (13FRLD / 13 kg payload)** and learned how to **program, calibrate, execute palletizing operations, and manage motion interpolation** in an industrial environment.

## 🧠 Skills & Learning Outcomes

| Topic | Experience Gained |
|-------|------------------|
| 🧭 Robot Calibration | Set up **base, tool & work origins** using the teach box |
| 📦 Palletizing | Configured **pick-place stacking patterns** and repeated cycles |
| 🔄 Interpolation | Used **Joint (J), Linear (L), and Circular (C) interpolation** for smooth trajectory control |
| ⚙️ Payload Handling | Motion planning with **13 kg load** safely and efficiently |
| 🔐 Safety | Speed tuning, override control, safe heights & collision prevention |
| 👨‍🏭 Teach Pendant | Practical programming & jogging via Mitsubishi teach box |

## 🏗 Practical Workflow Followed

🟩 **Pick → Safe Height → Travel → Position → Place → Repeat**  
with dynamic override tuning and tool origin compensation.

### 🔌 Core Steps Executed

## 💼 Why This Experience Matters

📍 Working with an **actual industrial robot** (not just simulations) taught me:

- Real robots demand **precision calibration**
- Motion interpolation strongly affects **smoothness & cycle time**
- Teach box proficiency is **essential in industry**
- Payload, inertia, and safety settings **cannot be ignored**
- Every decision has a **physical consequence**

> This experience marked a major upgrade in my robotics journey — from code to real machines.
