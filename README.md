## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my **real-world industrial robotic training**, transitioning from simulation-based robotics into **factory-grade robot programming and automation**.

I worked with a **6-axis Mitsubishi industrial robot (13FRLD / 13 kg payload)** and learned how to **program, calibrate, execute palletizing operations, and manage motion interpolation** in an industrial environment.

## 🧠 Skills & Learning Outcomes

| Topic | Experience Gained |
|-------|------------------|
| 🧭 Robot Calibration | Set up **base, tool & work origins** using the teach box |
| 📦 Palletizing | Configured **pick-place stacking patterns** and repeated cycles |
